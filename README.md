# Bedtimebot

Bedtimebot provides a gentle bedtime reminder to your Slack team members.
But watch out! It has a bit of a temper when you don't heed its suggestions.

Bedtimebot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

### Running Bedtimebot Locally

You can start Bedtimebot locally by running:

    % HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=<YOUR_API_TOKEN> ./bin/hubot --adapter slack

You will first have to [create a new bot user](#slack-environment-variables) to
get your API token.

Then you can interact with Bedtimebot by sending it a DM in Slack.

### Configuration

Follow the steps outlined in the [Slack Environment Variables](#slack-environment-variables)
section, then invite Bedtimebot to the Slack channels you would like it to
participate in.

## Deployment

    % heroku create
    % git push heroku master

If you run into any problems, checkout Heroku's [docs][heroku-node-docs].

More detailed documentation can be found on the [deploying hubot onto
Heroku][deploy-heroku] wiki page.

## Slack Environment Variables

To get up and running, you will need to set some environment variables.
First, [create a new bot user][new-bot-user] from your Slack team's settings
page and copy the API token.

    % heroku config:add HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN="..."

Next, find your Heroku app's URL. This is the endpoint that Bedtimebot will
ping every 20 minutes to prevent Heroku from putting your bot to sleep while
using Heroku's free tier.

    % heroku config:add APP_URL="..."

[new-bot-user]: https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot

## Restart the bot

You may want to get comfortable with `heroku logs` and `heroku restart` if
you're having issues.
